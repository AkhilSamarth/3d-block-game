# Block-Game
A simple block game made using OpenGL in C++.

Dependencies:
* GLFW for window-making and dealing with input ([link](https://www.glfw.org/))
* GLEW for including all of modern OpenGL's functions ([link](http://glew.sourceforge.net/))
* GLM for math (matricies, transformations, etc.) ([link](https://glm.g-truc.net/0.9.9/index.html))
* STB_Image by Sean Barrett for image IO ([link](https://github.com/nothings/stb/blob/master/stb_image.h))

Huge credit to [learnopengl.com](learnopengl.com) for being my main resource for learning OpenGL, as well as [docs.gl](docs.gl) for being my main source of OpenGL documentation.
