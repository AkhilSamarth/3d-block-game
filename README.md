# 3D Block Game

A 3D, block-based game in which the player can freely fly around and interact with a dynamically-generated, infinite world. This game was created from scratch using C++ and OpenGL, allowing me to learn a lot about how games work under the hood.

Huge credit to [learnopengl.com](https://learnopengl.com) for being my main resource for learning OpenGL, as well as [docs.gl](http://docs.gl) for being my main source of OpenGL documentation.

## Dependencies
* GLFW for window-making and dealing with input ([link](https://www.glfw.org/))
* GLEW for including all of modern OpenGL's functions ([link](http://glew.sourceforge.net/))
* GLM for math (matricies, transformations, etc.) ([link](https://glm.g-truc.net/0.9.9/index.html))
* STB_Image by Sean Barrett for image IO ([link](https://github.com/nothings/stb/blob/master/stb_image.h))
